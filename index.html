            <h3>Developers First</h3>
            <p>As Ratemarkt, as being a technology grounded SaaS company, developers are always going to be our first class
                citizens because we believe that there is no problem on earth which softwware can not solve except miscommunication.
                So we will always try so hard to improve our communication to them over easy to use SDKs,
                extensive set of client libraries and comprehensive documentations.</p>

            <h3>Global Marketplace</h3>
            <p>We are very proud of as being the first one inventing a real Travel Marketplace which any kind of
                hotel suppliers and travel agencies world wide can come together and make business for free.
                It's just a matter of opening a store in marketplace to start selling and just a matter of sending
                a client request to suppliers to start buying. You think of how payments will occur? Don't worry,
                Ratemarkt will be providing you a set of payment and remitment solutions for you.</p>

            <h3>Very Affordable</h3>
            <p>Thanks to being cloud based, Ratemarkt is very affordable by its various levels of subscription plans accompanied with <strong>Pay as You Go</strong> subscription model.
                Ratemarkt will never be doing a commission business among the suppliers and agencies but providing them the technology platform as long as they want to get benefit.
                And it's always risk free to start with Ratemarkt because you're totally free to cancel your subscription anytime wihtout any questioning.</p>
